# django-vue-docker
Sample implementation of a Django+Vue.js+Docker stack

## Rationale for this repository
:exclamation:  This is for educational purposes, there will be a lot of mistakes seen in this
repository as I learn and experiment with how to use Git, Vue.js, Django, Docker, GitHub actions, along with
integrating the best practice for each of these into my skillset.
